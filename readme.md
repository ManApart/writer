# Writer

Writer is built so you can write stories in MD wiki, quickly serve and preview them, and automatically build reference links to any topic (Character, Place, lore, item, etc).

Include an `index.md` file in your folder to act as a home page.
Include an `navigation.md` file in your folder to leverage a navigation pane.

## Updating

Run `node update --<path>` in the base folder where `<path>` is the path to your story repo

## Viewing

Navigate to the out folder and then run using `http-serve` and navigating to http://localhost:8080/mdwiki.html#!index.md
